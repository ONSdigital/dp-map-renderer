dp-map-renderer
================

Renders an SVG representation of a choropleth map given a topojson file and data.

See the [exampleResponse](testdata/exampleResponse.html) for an illustration of the sort of map that can be generated.
The testdata folder also includes example requests for both the render and analyse endpoints.
